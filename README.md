# Predicting_Employee_Turnover

This project analyzes employee data at Salifort Motors to predict potential departures using a Random Forest model. We identified key factors influencing employee churn, such as work hours and performance reviews. These insights inform targeted retention strategies to reduce turnover and associated costs.

Business Understanding 
Challenge:
Salifort Motors' HR department seeks data-driven insights to improve employee retention and satisfaction. They possess employee data but lack the expertise to analyze it effectively.

Objective:
This project utilizes data analytics to build a model predicting employee departures. By identifying factors influencing employee churn, Salifort Motors can develop targeted retention strategies and minimize associated costs.

Data Understanding:
Data is comprised of 15000 rows and 10 columns for variables related to the employee time at the company, including tenure, salary, number of projects, hours worked, if they received a promotion in the last 5 years, the department they work, their last self-reported avaliation of the company and if they left or not.
